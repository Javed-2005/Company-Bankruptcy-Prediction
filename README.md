<h2>:book: Introduction </h2>
A company faces bankruptcy when they are unable to pay off their debts.  

Prediction of bankruptcy is a phenomenon of increasing interest to firms who stand to lose money because on unpaid debts. Since computers can store huge dataset pertaining to bankruptcy making accurate predictions from them before hand is becoming important.
<h2>:scroll: Objective </h2>
The main objective of this project is to use various classification algorithms on bankruptcy dataset to predict bankruptcies with satisfying accuracies long before the actual event.

<h2> :floppy_disk: Data </h2>
The data includes a majority of numerical attributes that help understand the possibility of bankruptcy. The Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009 has listed the details of company bankruptcy based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.
